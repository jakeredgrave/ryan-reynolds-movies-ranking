        "Guy works as an assistant for a woman who's a copywrighter and whom everyone absolutely hates. When she realises her visa will expire soon and she'll have to return to Canada; she forces him to pretend they are engaged. In order to pull that whole thing off, they travel to visit his family in Alaska, where their relationship slowly evolves. ",
      myRemarks:
        "Enjoyable and funny. Extremely hilarious scene of Sandra Bullock dancing and rapping around a bonfire. Might by a little simple, but it's still very pleasing to watch.",

        "Guy who has schizophrenia and is able to talk with his dog and cat, tries to be a good man, but things don't go so well and he ends up becoming a murderer. Throughout the movie we slowly observe him dwell into his sickness and by so, lose rest of his sanity",
      myRemarks:
        "Absolutely incredible acting by Ryan Reynolds; the way he just flips the switch and makes his character absolutely intimidating and scary is crazy. On top of that, the movie has this special thing going on with the colors; usually we see the world the same way as protagonist, so it's colorful and clean, but on a few occasions we're allowed to see how it looks in reality. The final credits are also something that's worth mentioning, as leave you asking 'what the hell just happened' - trust me.",

Now they have to work together to save his girlfriend and fix everything that was messed up with time, by the woman who was a co worker of their (his, I guess, since they both are the same person) deceased father.",
      myRemarks:
        "Movie that started this whole Ryan Reynolds thing for me. Both Ryan and Walker play Adam well. Light story that doesn't make your brain explode with too much information. Beside lots of comedy scenes, there's one with Ryan Reynolds and Jennifer Garner that's really heartwarming and reminds you should always love your mom.",

      myRemarks:
        "A little long, although the story is really well-developed. At the beginning the movie was a bit boring, but gradually it became more and more interesting. Worth watching, if you like romance in movies, but aren't into pure romantic comedies.",

Guy accepts the offer and after being tortured for a long time his cancer is gone, but he becomes disfigured man with the superhuman ability of regeneration and physical prowess",
      myRemarks:
        "Ryan is a perfect Deadpool and that's a fact, but the story and the way it's told, unfortunately isn't. For some reason we jump in time to different moments and it really doesn't work well for the movie in my opinion. Most side characters are kinda boring, not to mention the bad guy.",

      myRemarks:
        "Movie isn't innovative, but it does it's job well. A bit too long, because each character took too much time to go through some inner change, by living in the body of the other one.",
